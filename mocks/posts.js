(Really, Ahnuld, have you looked at the credit markets lately?)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/10calif.html\">NY Times:</a> &ldquo;Although California feels the enormous effects of our current economic crisis, I am optimistic these efforts to improve liquidity are moving the country toward more stable economic footing,&rdquo; Mr. Schwarzenegger wrote, even as the stock market once again dropped sharply.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The letter comes as Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, begins appearing in radio advertisements intended to drum up interest in California bonds. The state plans to return next week to the bond market, which administration officials call their best hope, to seek $4 billion in normally routine short-term loans. It may seek more at a later date.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Analysts agreed the bond sales to Massachusetts and a couple of other states were encouraging, and said the governor had good reason for a more optimistic assessment as he entered the market seeking investors. Moreover, a loan from the Treasury would face difficulties. Aside from legal entanglements, assistance from the department could lead a bevy of state and local governments, also suffering financially, to ask for loans, too.</p>\r\n<p>Hmm, \"these efforts to improve liquidity\"...Like <a href=\"http://www.businesssheet.com/2008/10/hollywood-applauds-passage-of-bailout-bill\">the bailout bill that includes a bunch of tax breaks for Hollywood</a>, enabling studios to keep film and TV productions in Southern California?</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, we already noted that <a href=\"http://www.businesssheet.com/2008/10/iron-man-first-in-hollywood-to-benefit-from-hank-paulson-s-big-bailout\">the Hollywood tax breaks would provide a nice boost to the Los Angeles area econom</a>y. But could Governor Schwarzenegger's confidence also have been inspired by the fact that since he sent his first letter to Paulson, the Dodgers made it to the National League Championships?

The song jumped a record-breaking 95 spots this week to top Billboard's Hot 100 singles list. This is Britney's first number one single since 1999's \"Baby One More Time,\" which we find shocking. Nonetheless, she owes much of \"Womanizer's\" swagger up the charts to the track's also record-shattering digital downloads.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003874105\">Billboard:</a> Spears' single is spurred by first-week download sales of 286,000, the biggest opening-week tally by a female artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital downloads in 2003, besting Mariah Carey's take for \"Touch My Body\" by just over 200 units.</p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ie0a4ec066acfa66378f7fd734cfa4a2f\">Britney's reportedly launching a world tour this spring.</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Britney did premiere her \"Womanizer\" video on 20/20, but some of the clip's scenes, like the ones in which she's <em>naked</em>, were too hot for ABC. Ah, that's the problem with debuting a music video on network TV.</p>\r\n<p>So it's no surprise that the \"director's cut\" version, featuring Britney in the buff, has become an Internet sensation. MTV, which has been promoting the clip on its homepage, has already received more than 800,000 views of the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?artist=501686&amp;vid=288244\">video</a>, while various versions on YouTube have received as many as 45,000 plays.</p>\r\n<p>You could say this was a flaw in Britney's plan, but she's no fool. She knew 20/20 wouldn't be able to show as much as MTV, which means Britney found a way to get people who saw the clip on 20/20 to check it out online and keep MTV in the music-video game. Oh, Britney, don't try to front, we know just what you are.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EARLIER:</strong> We knew that Britney Spears was back last month when she stormed the VMAs looking like her old (read: good) self, but that was just the first step in the relaunch of Britney the brand. In doing this, Britney's made a number of calculated moves that illustrate the same sort of media control she used to have before she lost control&mdash;and her hair&mdash;and let the media control her.</p>\r\n<p>Britney's new single \"Womanizer\" hit radio two weeks ago and shot to the top of iTunes most downloaded songs list after it became available on Tuesday.</p>\r\n<p>The video <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/2020/CelebrityCafe/wireStory?id=5951582\">premieres on <em>20/20</em> tonight</a> in a bizarrely anachronistic move that's also somewhat unsurprising since Britney's career is so connected to her personal life.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Britney's re-emergence will also include a documentary, <em>For the Record</em>, which has been shooting for the past month or so. In it, Britney will presumably explain what she was thinking during her tabloid exploits of the past few years. It's an effort to reclaim control of her brand that's classic Britney Spears.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"So much has gone on over the last couple of years and there's a lot that people don't know about me that I want them to know.\" said Britney [<a href=\"http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/081010/nyf024.html?.v=101\">in the press release announcing <em>For the Record</em></a>]  \"I wanted to make this film because I started to feel like I wasn't being seen in the light that I wanted to be seen in.

A handful, however, noted that Warren had not done what he often does near a bottom: buy common stock. Instead, Warren bought perpetual preferred stock with a 10% coupon.</p>\r\n<p>While common-stock investors continue to get clobbered, moreover, Warren will be collecting his preferred dividend. And if the companies were to be liquidated, Warren would get his share before the common shareholders got a penny.</p>\r\n<p>That said, the market price for Warren's preferred stock in both Goldman and GE is probably well below what he paid for it. His options in both companies to buy common stock, moreover, are now way out of the money.</p>\r\n<p>Warren bought into Goldman when the stock was at $125 and GE at $22.50. At this writing, Goldman is trading at $81 and GE at $18.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.clusterstock.com/2008/10/warren-buffett-why-i-bought-ge-why-we-have-terrible-terrible-problems-\">Warren Buffett: We Have \"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible Problems\"</a></p>", "excerpt" : "Warren's not getting clobbered in Goldman and GE as badly as common stockholders are, but he's still taking it on the chin.&nbsp; And his options are now way out of the money.", "external" : false, "homepage_river" : true, "live" : true, "name" : "2008/10/warren-buffett-bludgeoned-but-now-we-know-why-he-bought-preferred-stock-", "ticker" : [  "GE",  "GS" ], "title" : "Warren Buffett Bludgeoned (But Now We Know Why He Bought Preferred Stock)", "ts" : ISODate("2008-10-10T12:59:00Z"), "type" : "story", "vertical" : "clusterstock", "vertical_river" : true, "verticals" : [  "clusterstock" ], "views" : 119 },

This means the ads users see, unless a publisher creates an iPhone-specific site, are the same as those viewed from a computer. The new option would in essence build a bridge between repurposing Internet ads for a mobile experience and creating a parallel structure for it.</p>\r\n<p>Google isn't the first company to figure out that the iPhone, and other phones that offer up the \"real\" Web, will require specialized advertising.

Get this point into your heads.\r\n\r\n·         For those of you that are not cash-flow positive, get there now.  Raising capital is nearly impossible if you're too far off of cash flow positive. \r\n\r\n·         There will be consequences for those who hesitate.  Act now.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEric Upin:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         It's always darkest before it's pitch black. \r\n\r\n·         Survival of this storm means drastic measures must be taken now, so you will have the opportunity to capitalize on this down turn in the future. \r\n\r\n·         We are in the beginning of a long cycle, what we call a \"Secular Bear Market.\"  This could be a 15 year problem.  [many slides on historical charts of previous recessions, averaging 17 year cycles.]\r\n\r\n·         The credit market [versus the Equity markets] are the issue and will take time to recover.\r\n\r\n·         Inflection point:  Make changes, slash expenses, cut deep and keep marching.  You can't be a general if you turn back.\r\n\r\n·         This is a global issue and not a 'normal' time.\r\n\r\n·         There is significant risk to growth and your personal wealth.\r\n\r\n·         Advice:\r\n\r\no   Manage what you can control.  You can't control the economy, but you can control everything else.\r\n\r\n§  Cut spending.  Cut fat.  Preserve Capital.\r\n\r\n§  Don't trust your models and spreadsheets.  All assumptions prior to today are wrong.\r\n\r\n§  Focus on quality.\r\n\r\n§  Reduce risk.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMichael Beckwith:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Note:  Michael had a lot of slides that were charts, data points and comparisons.\r\n\r\n·         A \"V\" shaped recovery is unlikely [√]\r\n\r\n·         Cuts in spending will accelerate in Q4/Q1.  Look at eBay—this is just the beginning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDoug Leone:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         This is a different animal and will take years to recover.\r\n\r\n·         Getting another round if you're not profitable will be rough.\r\n\r\n·         Do everything possible to get to cash flow positive.  Now.\r\n\r\n·         Nail your Sales and Marketing message.\r\n\r\n·         Pound your competitors shortcomings.  They're hurting and they will be quiet.  Take the offensive.\r\n\r\n·          In a downturn, aggressive PR and Communications strategy is key.\r\n\r\n·         M&A will decrease dramatically and only lean companies, with proven sales models will be acquired.\r\n\r\n·         Spectrum discussion:\r\n\r\no   Capital Preservation ß----------------------------------à Grab Market\r\n\r\no   Everyone should be far to the left (capital preservation)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Requirements of our companies:\r\n\r\no   You must have a proven product\r\n\r\no   You must cut expenses.  Now and deep.\r\n\r\no   Your product should reduce expenses and drive revenue \r\n\r\no   Honestly assess your solution vs. your competitors.\r\n\r\no   Cash is king [have you gotten this message yet?]\r\n\r\no   You must get to profitability as soon as possible to weather this storm and be self-sustaining.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Operations review:\r\n\r\no   Engineering:  Since you already have a product, strongly consider reducing the number of engineers that you have.\r\n\r\no   Product:  What features are absolutely essential?  Choose carefully and focus.\r\n\r\no   Marketing:  Measure everything and cut what is not working.  You don't need large Product Marketing, Product Management teams.\r\n\r\no   Sales & Business Development:  What is your return on this investment?  The Valley has gotten fat with Sales people:  Big bases, big variables.  Cut base salaries on sales people, highly leverage them with upside (increase variable) and make people pay for themselves via increased sales productivity.  Don't add sales people until you've achieved your goals with sales productivity.  Be disciplined.\r\n\r\no   Pipeline:  Scrub the shit out of it and be honest with yourself.\r\n\r\no   Finance:  Defer payments, what is essential?  Kill cash burn.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Death Spiral (Nobody moves fast enough in times like these, so get going and research later.)\r\n\r\no   The death spiral sucks you in, you're in it before you know it and then you die.\r\n\r\no   Survival of the quickest.\r\n\r\no   Cutting deeper is the formula for survival.\r\n\r\no   You should have at least one year's worth of cash on hand.\r\n\r\no   Tactics:\r\n\r\n§  Assess your situation.  Drop your assumptions, start with a blank page and start zero-based budgeting.\r\n\r\n§  Adapt quickly\r\n\r\n§  Make your cuts\r\n\r\n§  Review all salaries\r\n\r\n§  Change sales comp\r\n\r\n§  Bolster your balance sheet—if you can add $5M to your coffers, take it and save it.\r\n\r\n§  Spend like it's your last dollar.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n·         Get Real or Go Home.",   "ip" : "209.125.156.194",   "useragent" : "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3",   "isAdmin" : false,  "cid" : ObjectId("2bb9b914c683ee4860eb6400") },   {   "author" : "Peter Kafka",   "email" : "pkafka@alleyinsider.com",  "url" : "http://www.alleyinsider.com/peter_kafka",  "user_id" : ObjectId("f237544bce97a3477bb58500"),   "ts" : ISODate("2008-10-09T22:33:47.832Z"),   "text" : "Awesome, Joe.
