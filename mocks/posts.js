(Really, Ahnuld, have you looked at the credit markets lately?)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/10calif.html\">NY Times:</a> &ldquo;Although California feels the enormous effects of our current economic crisis, I am optimistic these efforts to improve liquidity are moving the country toward more stable economic footing,&rdquo; Mr. Schwarzenegger wrote, even as the stock market once again dropped sharply.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The letter comes as Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, begins appearing in radio advertisements intended to drum up interest in California bonds. The state plans to return next week to the bond market, which administration officials call their best hope, to seek $4 billion in normally routine short-term loans. It may seek more at a later date.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Analysts agreed the bond sales to Massachusetts and a couple of other states were encouraging, and said the governor had good reason for a more optimistic assessment as he entered the market seeking investors. Moreover, a loan from the Treasury would face difficulties. Aside from legal entanglements, assistance from the department could lead a bevy of state and local governments, also suffering financially, to ask for loans, too.</p>\r\n<p>Hmm, \"these efforts to improve liquidity\"...Like <a href=\"http://www.businesssheet.com/2008/10/hollywood-applauds-passage-of-bailout-bill\">the bailout bill that includes a bunch of tax breaks for Hollywood</a>, enabling studios to keep film and TV productions in Southern California?</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, we already noted that <a href=\"http://www.businesssheet.com/2008/10/iron-man-first-in-hollywood-to-benefit-from-hank-paulson-s-big-bailout\">the Hollywood tax breaks would provide a nice boost to the Los Angeles area econom</a>y. But could Governor Schwarzenegger's confidence also have been inspired by the fact that since he sent his first letter to Paulson, the Dodgers made it to the National League Championships?

The song jumped a record-breaking 95 spots this week to top Billboard's Hot 100 singles list. This is Britney's first number one single since 1999's \"Baby One More Time,\" which we find shocking. Nonetheless, she owes much of \"Womanizer's\" swagger up the charts to the track's also record-shattering digital downloads.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003874105\">Billboard:</a> Spears' single is spurred by first-week download sales of 286,000, the biggest opening-week tally by a female artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital downloads in 2003, besting Mariah Carey's take for \"Touch My Body\" by just over 200 units.</p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ie0a4ec066acfa66378f7fd734cfa4a2f\">Britney's reportedly launching a world tour this spring.</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Britney did premiere her \"Womanizer\" video on 20/20, but some of the clip's scenes, like the ones in which she's <em>naked</em>, were too hot for ABC. Ah, that's the problem with debuting a music video on network TV.</p>\r\n<p>So it's no surprise that the \"director's cut\" version, featuring Britney in the buff, has become an Internet sensation. MTV, which has been promoting the clip on its homepage, has already received more than 800,000 views of the <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?artist=501686&amp;vid=288244\">video</a>, while various versions on YouTube have received as many as 45,000 plays.</p>\r\n<p>You could say this was a flaw in Britney's plan, but she's no fool. She knew 20/20 wouldn't be able to show as much as MTV, which means Britney found a way to get people who saw the clip on 20/20 to check it out online and keep MTV in the music-video game. Oh, Britney, don't try to front, we know just what you are.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EARLIER:</strong> We knew that Britney Spears was back last month when she stormed the VMAs looking like her old (read: good) self, but that was just the first step in the relaunch of Britney the brand. In doing this, Britney's made a number of calculated moves that illustrate the same sort of media control she used to have before she lost control&mdash;and her hair&mdash;and let the media control her.</p>\r\n<p>Britney's new single \"Womanizer\" hit radio two weeks ago and shot to the top of iTunes most downloaded songs list after it became available on Tuesday.</p>\r\n<p>The video <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/2020/CelebrityCafe/wireStory?id=5951582\">premieres on <em>20/20</em> tonight</a> in a bizarrely anachronistic move that's also somewhat unsurprising since Britney's career is so connected to her personal life.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Britney's re-emergence will also include a documentary, <em>For the Record</em>, which has been shooting for the past month or so. In it, Britney will presumably explain what she was thinking during her tabloid exploits of the past few years. It's an effort to reclaim control of her brand that's classic Britney Spears.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"So much has gone on over the last couple of years and there's a lot that people don't know about me that I want them to know.\" said Britney [<a href=\"http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/081010/nyf024.html?.v=101\">in the press release announcing <em>For the Record</em></a>]  \"I wanted to make this film because I started to feel like I wasn't being seen in the light that I wanted to be seen in.

A handful, however, noted that Warren had not done what he often does near a bottom: buy common stock. Instead, Warren bought perpetual preferred stock with a 10% coupon.</p>\r\n<p>While common-stock investors continue to get clobbered, moreover, Warren will be collecting his preferred dividend. And if the companies were to be liquidated, Warren would get his share before the common shareholders got a penny.</p>\r\n<p>That said, the market price for Warren's preferred stock in both Goldman and GE is probably well below what he paid for it. His options in both companies to buy common stock, moreover, are now way out of the money.</p>\r\n<p>Warren bought into Goldman when the stock was at $125 and GE at $22.50. At this writing, Goldman is trading at $81 and GE at $18.</p>\r\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.clusterstock.com/2008/10/warren-buffett-why-i-bought-ge-why-we-have-terrible-terrible-problems-\">Warren Buffett: We Have \"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible Problems\"</a></p>", "excerpt" : "Warren's not getting clobbered in Goldman and GE as badly as common stockholders are, but he's still taking it on the chin.&nbsp; And his options are now way out of the money.", "external" : false, "homepage_river" : true, "live" : true, "name" : "2008/10/warren-buffett-bludgeoned-but-now-we-know-why-he-bought-preferred-stock-", "ticker" : [  "GE",  "GS" ], "title" : "Warren Buffett Bludgeoned (But Now We Know Why He Bought Preferred Stock)", "ts" : ISODate("2008-10-10T12:59:00Z"), "type" : "story", "vertical" : "clusterstock", "vertical_river" : true, "verticals" : [  "clusterstock" ], "views" : 119 },

This means the ads users see, unless a publisher creates an iPhone-specific site, are the same as those viewed from a computer. The new option would in essence build a bridge between repurposing Internet ads for a mobile experience and creating a parallel structure for it.</p>\r\n<p>Google isn't the first company to figure out that the iPhone, and other phones that offer up the \"real\" Web, will require specialized advertising.

Yes I have read all the commentary to date about Microsofts dominance with current netbooks, but I think the trends to date in the netbook market don't reflect future trends as emerging services and supporting infrastructure develop usage patterns for netbooks will change entirely. Most netbooks on the market today are really more like mediocre laptops than what I would consider a netbook ... they are meant to be multipurpose machines that don't do anything particularly well. 2 emerging trends will transform the use of the netbook in 2-5 years; The first is the increased utilization of web based applications coupled with the decreased need for client based apps, and the second is increased availability and speed of persistent mobile wireless data access. One of the most effective paths for a disruptive technology is to create an entirely new market ... much like the classic case study of the transistor radio, the perfect target to launch the chrome based netbooks at are students as young as first grade age. The PC has become such an important part of our lives that there is already a desire and a demand to have multiple PC's in a home ... even one per family member. If it were economically feasible parents would purchase more computers for there children, many homes already have several computers, but for most this is not feasible. Business models are starting to emerge, case in point being the recent offering from Sprint, where Netbooks can be funded through cellular service contracts. At the same time business models are emerging where Telephone and Cable companies are incorporating cellular plans into their Bundled service offerings and companies like Clearwire are starting to offer bundled home and mobile data access packages. Over time these services will start to make it feasible for parents to offer pervasive mobile internet to their entire family. The cost of netbooks could be incorporated into service contracts making it economically feasible (Cheap, actually) for parents to purchase netbooks for their children. The key driver for this will be homework, as it is becoming increasingly critical for children to have internet and PC access to finish homework, which contributes to the rising contention for the home based PC. I believe the day is not far off when we will see kids carrying around netbooks as commonly as they carry around cell phones today. PC's are already at the center of social patterns, as it is very common for even \"in person\" social activities to center around youtube or other online activities. Soon it will be the norm for children to visit their friends homes with notebook in hand and \"hanging out\" will consist of independently surfing the internet and sharing about what each has found ... and of course utilizing the netbook to enable study groups outside of the home. IMHO Chrome OS is very well poised to become the OS of choice for the next generation of Netbooks ... my definition of a netbook is a device that is optimized, perhaps exclusively, for internet access. Todays \"netbooks\" are really more like mediocre laptops intended to be inexpensive multipurpose machines, because the usage patterns of much of the target market require client based apps. A student today however already predominantly utilizes the internet ... google apps should be preferred for homework over Microsoft office. Also keep in mind, netbooks need not replace Home PC's ... but would rather supplement them by enabling a new market for a truly low cost computing platform that would create additional computing usage in the home rather than replacing the existing home PC. Applications such as gaming, Itunes and video editing could remain on the existing home PC. IMHO a Chrome OS based netbook could be truly optimized for internet access enabling it to not only be lighter, more battery efficient and cheaper than todays 'netbooks' and laptops, but also much faster at enabling internet access which would satisfy the younger generations increasing need for speed, impatience and increasing demand for instantaneous response. \r\nI can foresee the possibility in the not to distant future where emerging business models enable families to purchase entertainment bundles that include home and mobile pervasive internet access. The increase in usage of web based apps combined with the availability of pervasive internet access will create a class of users (students, initially) that have a demand for increased access to access primarily web based service that will create a new market for netbooks that has not been tapped into by the current generation of netbooks. The simplicity of Chrome OS (or similar) netbooks will help to drive down costs which combined with service contract based funding will make it not only possible, but desirable for parents to purchase netbooks for their children, not to replace, but to supplement the home PC. This seems simple, but think of the ramification; the predominant home pc usage pattern could very easily become 1 Windows based home PC combined with 2-5 Chrome based netbooks ... one for each family member in middle class homes. Simultaneously the netbook could enable internet access in homes that currently cannot afford a PC. So if the pattern I imagine here emerges, I don't think it is unrealistic that Chrome OS use could outnumber windows 4 or 5 to one in the home market in 5-7 years ... and all this could be done entirely without diminishing Windows market share ... by creating a new product and ecosystem that can satisfy both current and emerging demands for increasing PC usage in the home. I see this as being VERY analogous to the classic disruptive case study of Sony and the Transistor Radio Vs. RCA, with the Windows based home PC being the RCA home stereo and the Chrome OS based netbook analogous to the transistor radio. \r\nThe longer term implications of such a future would be truly disruptive ... students would be only the initial target market ... success in the student market would speed innovation and availability of 4g and greater pervasive internet access and a larger increase of  available web based applications. Increased mobile internet speeds and availability of web apps would gradually increase the addressable market, and users would migrate from more complex multi-purpose home PC's to internet optimized, simpler devices as the simple, faster, and cheaper devises grow to support the applications these users need. \r\n ",  "ip" : "128.107.239.233",   "useragent" : "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 GTB5" } ], "content" : "<p><img class=\"float_right\" src=\"/~~/f?id=48efd812796c7a0000a360f9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"MSOffice.jpg\" title=\"MSOffice.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />Google Docs is often talked about as a competitor to Microsoft&rsquo;s cash cow &ndash; the Office Suite &ndash; but the talks usually refer to some point in the future when everyone&rsquo;s running their applications in the cloud.

The Valley has gotten fat with Sales people:  Big bases, big variables.
